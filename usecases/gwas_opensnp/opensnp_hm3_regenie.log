extracting covariates...
Variable sex will be extracted as dummie, dropping 1 label (most frequent)
Variable batch will be extracted as dummie, dropping c1 label (most frequent)
writing 9 columns (including FID, IID) for n=4184 individuals to /home/opensnp_hm3_regenie.covar
extracting phenotypes...
variable: height_cm (CONTINUOUS), missing: 3391
writing 3 columns (including FID, IID) for n=4184 individuals to /home/opensnp_hm3_regenie.pheno
all --pheno variables have type: CONTINUOUS
