# Singularity

Here is a brief overview of available container [files](./../../singularity) (more info in the links below):

* [hello.sif](hello.md) - a simple container for demo purpose, allowing to experiment with singularity features
* [gwas.sif](gwas.md) - multiple tools (released as binaries/executables) for imputation and GWAS analysis
* [python3.sif](python3.md) - python3 environment with pre-installed modules and tools
* [r.sif](r.md) - R 4.0.5 environment with rareGWAMA, GenomicSEM, TwoSampleMR and GSMR packages installed (plus some standard R packages)

All containers have a common set of linux tools like ``gzip``, ``tar``, ``parallel``, etc.
Please open an issue if you'd like to add more of such basic tools.
Please [let us know](https://github.com/comorment/containers/issues/new) if you face any problems.
