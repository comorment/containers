* [hello.sif](https://github.com/comorment/containers/blob/main/docs/hello.md) - a simple container for demo purpose, allowing to experiment with singularity features

All containers have a common set of linux tools like ``gzip``, ``tar``, ``parallel``, etc.
Please open an issue if you'd like to add more of such basic tools.
