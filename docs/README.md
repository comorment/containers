* [hello.sif](hello.md) - a simple container for demo purpose, allowing to experiment with singularity features
* [gwas.sif](gwas.md) - multiple tools (released as binaries/executables) for imputation and GWAS analysis

All containers have a common set of linux tools like ``gzip``, ``tar``, ``parallel``, etc.
Please open an issue if you'd like to add more of such basic tools.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/comorment/containers/issues/new) if you face any problems.
