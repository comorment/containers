This README is a description of the files available to download as part of the Neale Lab GWAS of UK Biobank phenotypes.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
For a description of the project and details of the analysis, please see http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank                                                                                                                                                                                                      
To download GWAS results, see the links in the manifest tab below. At the top of each column in the manifest is a triangle.  Click the triangle and search options become available for that column.  Once you've found the code you are looking for, refer to the "wget command" column for the corresponding wget command to download the relevant results file.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The code used to generate the files described here is publicly available: https://github.com/Nealelab/UK_Biobank_GWAS.

This file contains annotations on each variant in the GWAS, calculated across the analysis subset of 361,194 samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                   
NOTE: The order of variants in this file matches the order of variants in the results files described below. To join these annotations with a results file, either match on the "variant" field or simply paste the columns together (e.g. "paste variants.tsv K50.gwas.imputed_v3.both_sexes.tsv").

icd10   These phenotypes were generated from UK Biobank fields 41202-0.0 - 41202-0.379. For each sample, the set of ICD10 codes (truncated to the first three characters, e.g. "K50") included in these fields was collected. The ICD10 phenotypes are booleans indicating whether the ICD10 code is included in that set of codes for each sample.                                                                                                                                                                                             
finngen These phenotypes were manually curated by collaborators in the FinnGen research project.
