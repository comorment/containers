GCTB is a software tool that comprises Bayesian mixed 
linear models for complex trait analyses using genome-wide 
SNPs. Version 2.0 includes summary-data based 
implementations of the previously implemented models.

System
------

We provide a statically linked 64-bit Linux executable, 
gctb, that has been tested on several Linux systems. The
software has also been compiled and run on Mac operating
systems but this will require installation. 

Installation
------------

Please see http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/download/README.html for detailed
installation instructions. Typical install time is less
than one hour on normal desktop computer.

Instructions for use
--------------------

Please see the tutorial on http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb
for a detailed description of how to run the summary-based 
components of the GCTB software on the demonstration data
derived from the 1000 Genomes. The tutorial and subsequent
files are representative of the process used to generate
the results in the BioRxiv paper "Improved polygenic 
prediction by Bayesian multiple regression on summary 
statistics" (https://doi.org/10.1101/522961).
