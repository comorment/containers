Based on file RsMergeArch.bcp.gz downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b151_GRCh38p7/database/organism_data/RsMergeArch.bcp.gz on 04/09/2018 (file modification data: 07/02/2018)
Using columns 1 (original rs ID) and 7 (current rs ID); entries are merged based on column 7 (columns defined with tab as separator)
RsMergeArch.bcp file is sorted on first column, therefore synonyms in processed file are ordered as current rs ID followed by older rs IDs in ascending order

NOTE: rs prefixes are omitted in file
NOTE: version is dbSNP 151
NOTE: first 50 entries in RsMergeArch.bcp file are improperly defined, and therefore skipped in processing
