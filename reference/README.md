## Reference

This folder containers publicly available reference, derived from different resources as documented below.

* [hapgen](https://github.com/comorment/containers/tree/main/reference/hapgen) folder contains artificially generated genotypes in ``plink`` format for N=10k individuals and M=149454 SNPs,
  with reasonably realistic LD structure representing chromosome 21 in EUR population
  (chr21 is choosen because it is the shortest chromosome in human genome); the data was generated using [HapGen2 software](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html).
